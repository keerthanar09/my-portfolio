        <strong>About:</strong> Existing Smart Surveillance Systems usually are only designed for one task such as violence detection, or extract only one feature for analysis, thereby missing a lot of important context and data that could not only drastically improve the results of the application, but also provide in-depth analysis of the scene that humans alone cannot achieve. This is exactly what the Smart Surveillance System for Public Mental Wellbeing tries to achieve. This application makes use of lightweight, accurate and privacy preserving models to analyze various features detected in a surveillance footage, and provide a dashboard that updates in real time and not only reports anomalies, but also keeps track of both positive and negative states of the area, and provides an explained, in-depth analysis of the data collected.  <br />

        <strong>About:</strong> This project was created for the problem statement OVERBURDENED TEACHERS AND THE
        NEED FOR PERSONALIZED FEEDBACKS at Google Solution Challenge 2025. It is still in development stages. The main goal is
        to create an application that can assist teachers in mundane, repetitive tasks, leaving them with extra timne to
        interact with students personally. <br />
